Figure Comments (based on FigureX.pdf files)

Figure 1:
1.   extract reads with picard
2.   align reads to hg19 with bwa
3.   tumor and blood are not aligned with SS. i would state "compare tumor and blood variants to call SNVs with SS"

Figure 4:
Some of the vertical axis labels are outside the margins

Figure 5:
Top, Left pane:  x-axis is unlabeled, some points appear in the legend
	Actually, there is no X-axis; this is a one dimensional plot; its just spread out to make it more readable
	As for the legend, I could not figure out how to do this. This is the only change you suggested that I did not do.

Figre 6:
Should the x-axis be on a log scale?
	I donâ€™t think it changes/helps much, actually, when I look at it; so I left it as is
