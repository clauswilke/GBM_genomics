1. For tumor-C484.TCGA-02-2486-01A-01D-1494-08.5: the FixMatePairs worked on the .sorted.bam, so now am running the dedup, etc. on that
   But in order to run the alignment, we actually need the blood file to run SNPs GATK, so we're going to align the blood first
2. We are aligning the blood in step one, which will allow us to carry out the second part of the test in (2) as well
3. Aligning tumor files through C484.TCGA-06-0152-02A-01D-2280-08.1, so we'll be starting the next set of alignmnets,
   and tests depending on parts (1) and (2), with C484.TCGA-06-0156-01A-01D-1491-08.5
4. Beginning to align blood files, with the only one in the working directory... it is aligning now...
   the plan will be to fix it if necessary, and use the fixed script in test (1)
   and the presumable mate-non-indexed one in test (2)
